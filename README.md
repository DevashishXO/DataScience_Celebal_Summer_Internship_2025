## Assignments

### Week 1 Assignment
- **Task**: Create lower triangular, upper triangular and pyramid containing the "*" character.

### Week 2 Assignment
- **Task**: Implement a singly linked list in Python using OOP, with methods to add, print, and delete nodes, including exception handling.

### Week 3 Assignment
- **Task**: Perform exploratory data analysis and visualization on any dataset using different python plotting libraries to uncover trends, patterns, and insights.

### Week 4 Assignment
- **Task**: Conduct an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis on a complex dataset. Focus on understanding data distributions, identifying missing values, detecting outliers, and uncovering relationships between variables. Utilize visualizations like histograms, box plots, and heatmaps to support your findings.

### Week 5 Assignment
- **Task**: Perform detailed data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation on a real-world housing dataset in preparation for advanced regression tasks. 

### Week 6 Assignment
- **Task**: Train multiple classification models on the Heart Disease dataset. Evaluate their performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV. Visualize and compare results to identify the best-performing model.

### Week 7 Assignment
- **Task**: Deploy a trained machine learning model using **Streamlit**. Develop a web application that allows users to input features, receive predictions, and understand the model output through interactive visualizations. This will help bridge the gap between model building and practical accessibility.
