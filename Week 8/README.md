## Project Description

This project implements a **Question-Answering chatbot** over structured loan application data using a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (RAG) approach. Users can ask natural-language questions (e.g., _"Do unmarried women get approved for loans?"_), and the bot will:

1. Retrieve the **most relevant loan entries** from the dataset using FAISS vector search.
2. Generate a **natural language answer** using a small language model (like `flan-t5-small`), grounded in the retrieved evidence.
3. Show **top-k matching document chunks** as sources used in the answer.

It is optimized to **run locally or on Hugging Face Spaces for free**, without paid API dependencies or large model usage.

## ðŸš€ How to Run the App Locally

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DevashishXO/DataScience_Celebal_Summer_Internship_2025
   cd .\DataScience_Celebal_Summer_Internship_2025\
   cd .\Week 8\
   ```
2. **Set up a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Prepare the dataset**
   - Place the `train.csv` and file in the `data/` directory.
   - Run the notebook `assignment_week8.ipynb` to preprocess the data and create the FAISS index.
   - This will generate the vector store files in `rag_chatbot/vector_store/`.

5. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   cd .\rag_chatbot\
   python .\app.py
   ```

6. **Access the app**
   - Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:7860`
   - You should see the chatbot interface where you can ask questions about loan approvals.
   - Example query: "What kind of applicants get approved for a loan?" ; "What kind of people usually get rejected?" ; "Does credit history affect loan approval?"
